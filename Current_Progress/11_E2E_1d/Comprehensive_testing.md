# Some results from comprehensive testing



### All the parameters space

![SM_parameter_space](/pics/SM_parameter_space.png)

This parameter space contains about 1296 sets of SM = {A,B,H,Q,R}

For each 3 sets of SM, it takes about 55 seconds to finish running. This all parameter space takes about 7 hours to finish. I tried that the other night, but it stopped again because of some bugs. So I separated this into different subset and tried to find out where the bugs lied.

### subset 1

This subset 1 contains 36 sets of SM, and it took about 11.86 mins to finish running.

### subset 2

This subset 2 contains 72 sets of SM, and it took about 23.56 mins to finish running.

### subset 3

This subset 3 contains 108 sets of SM, and it took about $2059 s \approx 34.31 mins$  to finish running.

### subset 4

This subset 3 contains 72 sets of SM, and it took about $ s \approx  mins$  to finish running.
